            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

RELATIVE DUTIES
Is a very great Honour and Ornament to the
DOCTRINE of the GOSPEL;
Without, which the talk of Godlineſs, and Profeſſion of Religion, is vain; and
therefore all Chriſtians ſhould labour to underſtand their Relative Duties,
and be careful and conſcionable in the diſcharge of them.</head>

               <head>The Duties of Wives.</head>
               <p>1. TIs their duty to love their
Husbands: this is a duty that
helps to the right performance of
every duty no; duty will be well
diſcharged without it, tis ſo neceſſary
that the Apoſtle would not only
have <hi>Titus</hi> preſs it himſelf, but put
the aged women upon teaching
the younger to love their Husbands.
<hi>Tit.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>2. To be ſubject to their husbands,
this is the Cardinal, vertue, the prime
vertue of a wife, therefore the
Apoſtles do ſo oft in plain expreſs
termes require and preſs it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.
22. 23. <hi>Col. 3. 18. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 1. 'tis
a breach of God's order when Wives
are not ſubject.</p>
               <p>3. To be faithful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they muſt
not in word or action be unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Husbands, this is a
breach of Covenant, yea the Lords
Covenant, <hi>Prov</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>4. To be careful to pleaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 34. the Apoſtle takes it for
granted, that a good wife dos ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe ought to do ſo.</p>
               <p>5. To endeavour to win the
ſouls of their Husbands, and that;
1. By a holy Converſation a good
carriage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. 2. By gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
perſwading them to mind
the good of their ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
16.</p>
               <p>6. To bear quietly and patiently
with their Husbands. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. as
wives ſhould not provoke their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
ſo they ſhould not eaſily be
provoked by them.</p>
               <p>7. To reverence their Husbands,
the Holy Ghoſt takes notice of it as
a commendable thing in <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe
call'd her Husband Lord, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6.
tis mentioned as an uſual thing done
by her.</p>
               <p>8. To be helpful to, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one end
of the Wives Creation was to help
her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18. they muſt

eſpecially the Husband is to love

3. 7. the Husband muſt forſake Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother and cleave to his
Wife, <hi>G.</hi> 2. 24. Where the Apoſtle
ſtates the queſtion of ſeparating for
faſting and prayer by conſent, he
ſhews muſt be only for a time, and
then they muſt come together
again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5. Chriſt condemns
the Jews putting away their Wives
when they diſliked them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.</p>

               <p>4. To pray with his Wife. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 9. the Apoſtle takes it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that good Husbands and Wives
pray together, that tis their manner
and cuſtom to do ſo. They have
mutual need of protection, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
many bleſſings.</p>

otherwiſe the Lord will be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

               <p>6. Wiſely to manage their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

thing, yea a thing contrary to
Scripture, for Servants to be ſaucy
and checkmate, with their Maſters,
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. all honour. <hi>i. e.</hi> in
ſpeech and behaviour. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18.
they muſt inwardly reverence their
Maſters from the heart, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
declare it in word and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
yea though they be not good
and gentle, but froward. Servants
are apt to deſpiſe and contemn thoſe
that are peeviſh and froward, but
this they muſt not do, they muſt
have reſpect to the Ordinance of
God, imply'd <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>2. To obey their Maſters. Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
doth not teach Servants to be
looſe and careleſs; this obedience
muſt be, 1. Chearful, not by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
but free, willing. 2. Sincere,
aiming at the good and welfare
of their Maſters. 3. Univerſal, in all
things, <hi>i. e.</hi> all lawful things; for
otherwiſe they muſt obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than men, <hi>Eph. 6. 5. 7. Col.</hi> 3.
22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>3. To be diligent in their Maſters
buſineſs, the wicked and ſlothful
Servant are joyn'd together, <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. 26. This diligence muſt not only
be in the Maſters preſence, but in his
abſence, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
               <p>4. To bear patiently the checks
and reproofs of their Maſters, they
muſt not be croſs and curriſh, not
give word for word, gain-ſaying is
a great evil in a Servant, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9.</p>
               <p>5. To be faithful to their Maſters,
the other are nothing without this:
Let a Servant be skilful, painful, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
and of good carriage, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without faithfulneſs, all other
properties of a Servant ſtink with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
faithfulneſs, this is the prime
vertue of a ſervant. Chriſt joyns
good and faithful Servant together,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 21, 23. a Servant can never
be a good Servant that is not a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. Muſt ſhew
all good fidelity. This faithfulneſs
muſt extend to their Maſters name,
eſtate, bodys, ſoules, relations, and
muſt be equal and entire in all parts
of faithfulneſs, in all kind of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of Maſters.</head>
               <p>1. TO be gentle, not harſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
like the Task-Maſters
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> this is unbecoming Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Maſters, the Apoſtle joyns the
good and gentle together, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.
18. muſt not be outragious for every
trifle, but gentle, kindly, bear with
their Servants. Maſters ſhould be as
fathers to their Servants, not only in
point of ſuperiority over their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
but in point of loving and
tender reſpect to their Servants,
2 <hi>King. 5. 13. Eph.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p>2. To keep up their authority; loſe
this, and the beauty of a family is
loſt, and, 'tis much if ſad confuſion
don't creep into the family; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in whoſe ſtead thou art, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and Governour of a family thou
repreſenteſt God himſelf, who is the
Maſter and Governour of all, and
therefore thou ſhouldeſt maintain
the dignity of the place wherein
the Lord hath ſet thee.</p>
               <p>3. To provide convenient, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
food and rayment for their
Servants. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 15, 21. are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with ſcarlet, or double gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>i. e.</hi> they are well clothed
againſt the cold, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p>4. To look to their commands;
both as to, 1. The matter of
them; Maſters muſt ſee their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
be lawful and good, muſt
not impoſe any thing upon Servants
which the Lord hath not warranted
in his word, not require Servants
to lye or filch for them, or break the
Sabbath. 2. The meaſure, Maſters
muſt not impoſe more labour upon
their Servants than they have
ſtrength well and comfortably to
perfom; this is oppreſſion and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Eſai.</hi> 58. 6.</p>
               <p>5. To protect and ſhelter their
Servants, muſt not ſuffer them to be
wronged and abuſed by others; as
the Lord is a ſhield to his Servants,
<hi>Pſa.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
               <p>6. To take care of their Servants
in their ſickneſs and weakneſs, and
uſe means for their recovery, <hi>Mat.</hi>
8. 6.</p>
               <p>7. To endeavour the good of the
ſouls of their Servants: of all duties
this is the greateſt, and yet moſt
neglected; good <hi>Joſhua</hi> would not
Serve God alone, but have his hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold
ſerve God with him, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24.
15. what a Religious family <hi>Abraham</hi>
had; as they were train'd in civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and military poſtures. <hi>Gen.</hi>
14. 14. ſo in Religious matters too.</p>
